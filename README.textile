h1. Ginsu Hybrid

This is an example of a hybrid web site that's designed in Dreamweaver and powered by Ruby on Rails.  To update the design, you update the static Dreamweaver files.  To update the behavior of the web site, you update the Rails application.  "Ginsu":http://github.com/endymion/ginsu/tree/master handles integrating the two.
